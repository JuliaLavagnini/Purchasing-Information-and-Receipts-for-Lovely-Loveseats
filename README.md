# CodeCademy Python first project

I created a fictional furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street. With my newfound knowledge of Python programming, I build a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for the customers.

In this project, I stored the names and prices of a furniture storeâ€™s catalog in variables. Then I processed the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.
